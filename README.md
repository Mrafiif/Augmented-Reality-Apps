Project Overview
Developed a highly engaging Augmented Reality (AR) application using Snap Lens Studio, focusing on seamless interaction between digital assets and the physical world. This project demonstrates proficiency in creating real-time visual effects and interactive experiences that leverage advanced computer vision algorithms to enhance user engagement.

Key Technical Implementations
Advanced Face Tracking: Successfully implemented precise face tracking technology to overlay complex 3D digital masks and cosmetic enhancements that respond dynamically to facial expressions.

Real-Time Body Tracking: Developed interactive AR elements that follow human skeletal movements, allowing digital objects to react or attach accurately to the user’s body in real-time.

Environment Interaction: Optimized lighting and shadows to ensure that virtual objects blend naturally with the user’s actual surroundings for a more realistic immersion.

Asset Optimization: Carefully managed and optimized 3D models and textures to ensure high performance and low latency on mobile devices.

Tech Stack & Tools
Development Environment: Snap Lens Studio.

Core Technologies: AR Core / AR Kit principles, Computer Vision, and 3D Asset Management.

Interaction Design: Face & Body Mesh Tracking.
